Complying with this implementation guide means complying with a number of profiles, extensions, value sets and custom search parameters.  This page provides an overview of where this information can be found.

The artifacts are of four types:

* [Profiles]({{site.data.fhir.path}}profiling.html) constrain FHIR resources to reflect Postable Remittance requirements
* [Extensions]({{site.data.fhir.path}}extensibility.html) define additional data elements that can be conveyed as part of a resource
* [Code Systems]({{site.data.fhir.path}}codesystem.html) define Postable Remittance-specific terminologies to be used in one or more of those profiles
* [Value Sets]({{site.data.fhir.path}}valueset.html) define the specific subsets of both Postable Remittance-defined and other code systems that can be (or are recommended to be) used within one or more profile elements
* [Operations]({{site.data.fhir.path}}operationdefinition.html) which define the Postable Remittance-specific operations for each of the use cases.
