### Privacy & Security Considerations
The profiles in this IG are defined to ensure sufficient information to properly search for a previously sent postable remittance.  There are existing processes that payers and clearinghouses take to secure their portals and similar processes should be taken to secure access to the APIs defined in this IG.

Some of the data shared as part of the postable remittance process may have associated constraints on the use of that information for other purposes, including subsequent disclosure to other payers, practitioners, policy-holders, etc. HL7 FHIR supports conveying this information via security labels on transmitted resources.

In order to make queries about postable remittances, the provider system will need to access the payor system. This will require that the provider system authenticates to the payer system or an intermediary. Every system implementing the Prior Authorization guide will need to be aware of and follow the guidance in the FHIR Core Specification on [Clinical Safety](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/safety.html), the FHIR Core Specification on [Security](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/security.html) and the [Security and Privacy page in the Da Vinci HRex guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-hrex/security.html).
